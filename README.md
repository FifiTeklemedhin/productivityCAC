## This is an application for the `Congressional App Challenge`!

## Application Description

We want to create an app that allows users to be productive by predicting how long it takes them to accomplish tasks based on user inputted data over a period of time.
This would allow them to schedule their days properly with accurate estimated times to accomplish their tasks. We would use a neural network or machine learning algorithm that would
estimate the amount of time for each task by collecting data from the user. Our goal to help users reach a new level of productivity so that they can realistically schedule their days.
