## This is an application for the `Congressional App Challenge`!

## Application Description

We want to create an app that allows users to predict how long certain tasks will take them to complete. This would allow the user to properly schedule their day with accurate time estimates for each desired task.

We would use a neural network or machine learning algorithm that would
estimate the amount of time a task requires by collecting data from the user over a period of time. Our goal to help users reach a new level of productivity by enabling them to realistically schedule their days.
